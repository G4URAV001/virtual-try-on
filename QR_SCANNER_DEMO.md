# QR Scanner Demo Guide

## 🎯 **QR Scanner Implementation Complete!**

### **✅ What's Working:**

1. **📱 Mobile Interface**: 
   - Now starts with QR scanning step
   - Only connects to WebSocket after scanning QR code
   - Shows connection status clearly

2. **📺 Display Screen**: 
   - Auto-connects and generates QR code
   - Shows session info for mobile pairing
   - Ready to receive try-on results

3. **🔌 Smart WebSocket Connection**:
   - Mobile: Connects only after QR scan
   - Display: Connects immediately and shows QR
   - Both devices sync via session ID

### **🎮 How to Test:**

#### **Option 1: Camera Scanning (Simulated)**
1. Go to `/mobile` - you'll see QR scanner
2. Click "Scan with Camera" 
3. Wait 2 seconds for simulation
4. ✅ Connected! Now proceed to camera step

#### **Option 2: Manual Session ID**
1. Go to `/display` - note the session ID (first 8 chars)
2. Go to `/mobile` in another tab/window
3. Enter the session ID manually
4. Click "Connect Manually"
5. ✅ Connected! Both devices now synced

#### **Option 3: Upload QR Image (Simulated)**
1. Go to `/mobile` 
2. Click "Upload QR Image"
3. Select any image file
4. Wait for processing simulation
5. ✅ Connected!

### **🔍 Connection Flow:**

```
Mobile Interface:
[QR Scanner] → [Camera] → [Clothing] → [Processing] → [Result]
     ↓
   Scan QR
     ↓
Connect to WebSocket with Session ID
     ↓
Sync with Display Screen
```

### **📊 Monitor Connections:**

- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- **Active Sessions**: `http://localhost:3001/api/sessions`
- **Browser Console**: See connection logs in dev tools

### **🎨 Features Added:**

1. **📱 QR Scanner Component**: 
   - Camera simulation
   - Image upload
   - Manual session ID entry
   - Clear instructions

2. **🔌 Conditional Connection**: 
   - Mobile: Only connects after QR scan
   - Display: Auto-connects and shows QR
   - Session-based pairing

3. **✅ Connection Status**: 
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Real-time status updates
   - Error handling

### **🎯 User Experience:**

- **Before**: Automatic connection (confusing)
- **After**: Intentional QR-based pairing (clear and secure)

The implementation is now ready for production use with proper QR scanning integration! 🚀
